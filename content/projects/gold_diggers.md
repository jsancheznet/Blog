This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2021. It was my first game
jam ever, i had a lot of fun. The theme of 2021 was "Lost &
Found". After hours of not knowing what game to make we decided to
make the game about pirates and it naturally became a "find the
treasure" game, borrowing ideas from minesweeper.
